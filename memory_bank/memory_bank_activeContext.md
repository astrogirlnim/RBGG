# Active Development Context - Current Focus

## Current Sprint: Local Pipeline Development

### Primary Objective
Develop and test the game generation pipeline locally without requiring Roblox API integration. Focus on template system, content generation, and quality validation components.

### Current Working Session Status
- **Phase**: Phase 1, Step 3 completion with pivot to local development
- **Last Completed**: Roblox Open Cloud API client implementation with comprehensive error handling
- **Current Focus**: Game template system and local pipeline testing
- **Next Priority**: Template-first assembly engine development

## Recent Achievements (This Session)

### ‚úÖ Completed Infrastructure
1. **Enhanced Roblox API Client** (`src/api/roblox.js`)
   - Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Rate limiting (90/100 requests per minute)
   - Robust error handling for Roblox-specific error codes
   - Group management and publishing methods with attribution
   - API usage statistics and monitoring

2. **Configuration System** (`src/config/environment.js`)
   - Centralized environment variable validation
   - Helpful error messages with setup guidance
   - Development and production environment support
   - Automatic .env.example generation

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Setup validation utilities (`src/utils/roblox-setup.js`)
   - Standalone setup guide (`scripts/setup-guide.js`)
   - API structure testing without real API calls (`scripts/test-api-structure.js`)
   - Comprehensive npm scripts for development workflow

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated PRD checklist with completion status
   - Marked deferred items (group creation, API key setup)
   - Created memory bank structure for project knowledge

### üîÑ Current Development Decisions

#### Roblox Group Creation Deferred
- **Issue**: Creating "Prompted Playgrounds" group requires 100 Robux ($1.25)
- **Decision**: Defer group creation until ready for production testing
- **Impact**: Continue development with local testing and mock data
- **Workaround**: Template development and pipeline testing can proceed without API

#### Development Strategy Pivot
- **From**: Full API integration testing
- **To**: Local pipeline development and validation
- **Rationale**: Maximize development progress while deferring costs
- **Benefits**: Template system and content generation can be fully developed offline

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Template System Development
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- Implement base template structure for Obby, Tycoon, Simulator
- Create parameter injection system for customization
- Develop template validation and testing framework

### 2. Content Generation Engine
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
- Build prompt-to-parameter mapping system
- Implement template assembly logic
- Create content generation pipeline with quality gates

### 3. Local Testing Framework
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
- Develop comprehensive local testing without API calls
- Create mock data and validation scenarios
- Implement automated quality checks for generated content

### 4. Quality Validation System
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- Automated playability checks (spawn, movement, core mechanics)
- Script validation and error detection
- Integration points for human playtesting workflow

## Technical Context

### Available for Development
- ‚úÖ Complete Node.js pipeline infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Roblox development toolchain (Rojo, Selene, StyLua, TestEZ)
- ‚úÖ Configuration and testing frameworks
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging systems

### Waiting on External Dependencies
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Roblox group "Prompted Playgrounds" (100 Robux cost)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Production Open Cloud API key (after group creation)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Live API integration testing (after credentials)

### Development Environment Status
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/ns/Development/GauntletAI/RBGG`
- **Node.js**: Ready with all dependencies installed
- **Git**: Active on `phase-1-dev-env` branch
- **Tools**: Cursor IDE with Roblox extensions configured

## Key Decisions & Context

### Template-First Approach Confirmed
- Start with curated, safe templates for reliability
- Focus on 3 initial genres: Obby, Tycoon, Simulator
- Parameter injection for customization within safe bounds
- Quality over quantity for MVP release

### Testing Strategy
- Local development and testing without external API calls
- Mock data and validation for pipeline development
- Integration testing when credentials become available
- Comprehensive error handling already implemented

### Documentation Strategy
- Memory bank created for project knowledge preservation
- PRD checklist updated with current status
- Technical documentation maintained alongside development
- Setup guides and testing utilities provided for team use

## Questions & Considerations

### Immediate Development Questions
1. Which template genre should we implement first? (Recommendation: Obby - simplest mechanics)
2. What level of parameter customization should we support initially?
3. How complex should the content generation logic be for MVP?
4. What automated quality checks are most critical for safety?

### Future Planning Considerations
1. When should we prioritize Roblox group creation and API integration?
2. How will we handle scaling to multiple concurrent generations?
3. What metrics should we track for generated game quality?
4. How will we integrate Discord bot functionality in Phase 2?

## Current Development Momentum
**Status**: High momentum with clear path forward for local development
**Blockers**: None for current sprint (API integration deferred by design)
**Team Readiness**: Full development environment prepared, comprehensive infrastructure complete
**Next Session**: Focus on template system architecture and implementation
