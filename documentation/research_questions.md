Questions (to refine scope)

Age & Compliance

Are you targeting under 13, 13–17, or all ages? (Discord’s TOS is 13+, Roblox has its own age buckets; COPPA matters if under 13.)

Based on the proposal's focus on "kids" in the context of Roblox (which has a large under-13 user base but categorizes experiences by age buckets: under 13 with heavy restrictions like limited messaging, 13+ for more features, and 18+ for mature content), and considering Discord's strict Terms of Service requiring users to be at least 13 years old in most regions (including the US, with some EU countries at 14-16), the project should target 13–17 or all ages 13+ to ensure compliance. Targeting under 13 would violate Discord's TOS, expose the server to shutdown risks, and trigger COPPA obligations, as the server would involve collecting potentially personal information (e.g., game ideas tied to user profiles) from children under 13. If the goal is to include younger users, consider pivoting to an in-Roblox community or web-based tool instead.

Will you require parental consent or any age verification?

To comply with COPPA—which mandates verifiable parental consent for collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13 on US-directed online services—no parental consent would be required if targeting 13+, as the rule does not apply to that age group. However, for added safety and to enforce the 13+ policy, implement basic age verification, such as self-reported age gates during server joining (e.g., via bot prompts) or requiring a linked email for confirmation, though this isn't strictly mandatory under Discord's TOS or COPPA for 13+ users. If any under-13 access slips through, you'd need mechanisms like parental email consent forms to retroactively comply, but this is best avoided by clear rules and moderation.

Moderation

What’s your tolerance for automation vs. human review? (e.g., 80% auto, 20% manual?)

Aim for an 80% automation and 20% human review tolerance to balance efficiency, scalability, and safety in a teen-focused Discord server. This ratio allows bots (e.g., MEE6 or Dyno) to handle routine tasks like keyword filtering, spam detection, and initial content blurring for sensitive media, which Discord recommends for teen communities through features like automatic sensitive content filters. Human moderators (ideally including trained teens aged 13-17, as suggested in recent studies on youth-led Discord communities) would step in for nuanced cases, such as ambiguous ideas or appeals, ensuring compliance while preventing over-reliance on AI that might miss context. This approach aligns with best practices for teen servers, where auto-moderation handles high volume but humans provide oversight to foster positive environments and reduce mental health risks like toxicity.

Do you want pre‑submission filters (prompt lints/suggestions) or only post-submission review?

Incorporate both pre-submission filters (e.g., prompt lints and suggestions) and post-submission review for a proactive, layered moderation system. Pre-submission tools, such as bot-driven prompts that suggest refinements (e.g., "Avoid political themes—try focusing on fun pet ideas instead!") or lint for banned words, can guide users in real-time during idea entry, reducing invalid submissions and educating teens on guidelines, as recommended in Discord's community safety resources. Post-submission review would then catch any oversights via auto-filters followed by human checks, ensuring thoroughness without frustrating users. This hybrid prevents issues upstream while aligning with parent guides that emphasize quick check-ins and positive community norms for teens.

Any banned themes/words beyond the obvious?

Beyond obvious prohibitions like violence, discrimination, explicit content, harassment, or illegal activities, ban themes and words related to politics (e.g., discussions of political figures, elections, or parties), real-life tragedies or sensitive historical events (e.g., terrorism, genocide), gambling or simulated betting, dating/romance (to avoid predatory risks), alcohol/drugs (including references like "party" in certain contexts), and misinformation or conspiracy theories, as outlined in Roblox's Community Standards to maintain a civil, family-friendly environment. Specific words/phrases to block include those tied to recent 2025 updates, such as "Roblox" or "Blox" in usernames/creations (to prevent IP misuse), and emerging "Sensitive Issues" labels for vague topics like mental health crises or real-world conflicts that could trigger automatic hiding. Use Roblox's Blocked Words feature for custom filters in generated games, and extend this to Discord submissions to ensure alignment.

Generation Quality & Guardrails

Are you okay with template-first generation (fill-in-the-blanks into curated Roblox templates) vs. full freeform gen?

Yes, prioritize a template-first approach (fill-in-the-blanks into curated Roblox templates) over full freeform generation for launch, as it ensures higher reliability, playability, and kid-friendliness while aligning with Roblox's ecosystem of pre-built assets and modules (e.g., from the Creator Marketplace or open-source GitHub repos like Roblox Aurora). This method uses AI to customize vetted templates (e.g., inserting user-specified mechanics like "add pet collection" into a simulator base) via tools like Roblox Code Assist, reducing risks of broken code or exploits. Full freeform can be added later as an advanced feature once the pipeline is stable, but starting templated keeps games fun, easy to generate, and compliant with safety standards.

Minimum viable genres at launch? (e.g., Obby, Tycoon, Simulator, RPG-lite)

Launch with three minimum viable genres: Obby (obstacle courses for simple platforming fun), Tycoon (resource management and building for progression appeal), and Simulator (repetitive grinding with upgrades, like pet or farming sims). These are among Roblox's top-played genres (e.g., obbies like Tower of Hell with billions of visits, tycoons for monetization potential, and simulators for addictive loops), easy to template with modular scripts, and accessible for kids to conceptualize via prompts. This focused set allows quick iteration, covering core mechanics like parkour, economy, and collection, while expanding to RPG-lite (light role-playing with quests) post-launch based on user feedback.

How will you handle failed generations or non-playable results (fallbacks, retries, manual fixes)?

Implement a multi-tiered system: First, automated retries (e.g., re-prompt the AI up to 3 times with refined instructions if initial output fails validation checks like script syntax errors or missing mechanics, using Roblox Studio's debugging APIs). If retries fail, fallback to a basic "safe mode" template (e.g., a generic obby with minimal customizations) to ensure something playable is delivered. For persistent issues, flag for manual fixes by moderators (e.g., quick human tweaks in a staging Studio instance before publishing), with users notified via Discord (e.g., "Your game needed a polish—check the updated link!"). Track failures via logs to improve the AI pipeline over time, maintaining a 95%+ success rate goal for user satisfaction.

Publishing & Ownership

Will games publish under a Roblox Group (recommended) or a personal account?

Publish games under a dedicated Roblox Group, as this is the recommended best practice for community-driven projects like this Discord server initiative. Groups offer advantages such as granular permissions for collaborators (e.g., allowing moderators to publish updates without full access), better Robux management for any earnings (funds stay in the group for easy distribution), and reduced personal risk (e.g., separating project assets from your individual account to avoid unwanted edits or security issues). Even for solo-managed servers, publishing under a group enhances scalability if the community grows, aligns with Roblox's 2025 updates for experience permissions, and minimizes cons like visit counts not accruing to a personal profile (which isn't critical here). Personal accounts are simpler for quick tests but not ideal for shared, user-proposed content.

Do proposers get credit/attribution, co-ownership, or just a shoutout link?

Proposers will receive credit through a shoutout attribution link (e.g., "Idea by [Discord Username] – Play here: [Roblox link]") embedded in the game's description, loading screen, or in-game credits, along with a Discord message sharing the link back to them and the community. This provides visible recognition without granting co-ownership, as game ideas themselves aren't typically copyrightable under Roblox's Terms of Use, and full ownership would complicate legal aspects like IP rights, revenue sharing, or liability for user-generated content (UGC). Co-ownership is avoided to prevent risks such as disputes over modifications or bans due to unauthorized use, keeping the focus on fun, community-driven shoutouts while the central group retains control for moderation and compliance.

Discord Flow

Submission via slash commands, forms, or channel posts?

Use a combination of slash commands and forms for submissions to balance ease-of-use and structure in a teen-focused Discord server. Slash commands (e.g., /propose-game) provide quick, interactive entry points accessible via mobile or desktop, allowing users to input ideas directly with guided parameters (e.g., genre, description), which aligns with Discord's 2025 updates emphasizing bot integrations for community engagement. Forms (modals triggered by the command) can then pop up for detailed prompts, ensuring submissions are organized and complete while reducing spam in channels. Avoid relying solely on channel posts, as they can clutter discussions and make moderation harder, though allow optional embeds for sharing ideas post-submission.

Do you want a queue/status tracker in Discord (e.g., “In Review → Approved → Generating → Playtest → Published”)?

Yes, implement a queue/status tracker in Discord to enhance transparency and user engagement, displaying stages like “In Review → Approved → Generating → Playtest → Published” via a dedicated channel or bot commands (e.g., /status [idea-ID]). This can be managed by bots like Carl-bot or custom ones using Discord's API for real-time updates, with embeds showing progress bars or notifications. It fosters a sense of progression for teens, encourages patience during moderation/generation, and allows for community feedback at playtest stages, while logs help moderators track bottlenecks for scalability.

Review & Playtest

Any internal playtest step before auto-publish?

Yes, incorporate an internal playtest step before auto-publish to verify playability, catch bugs, and ensure the game aligns with fun, kid-friendly standards, following Roblox best practices that emphasize testing changes and using features like unlisted modes for early feedback. This could be semi-automated: Run quick script validations and AI checks for basic functionality (e.g., no crashes, core mechanics work), followed by a brief moderator review or community playtest in a staging environment, with the status updated in the Discord tracker before final publishing.

Do you want auto-generated thumbnails/trailers?

Yes, enable auto-generated thumbnails to enhance discoverability and appeal, leveraging Roblox's native auto-generation tools or trending AI makers for quick, branded visuals that follow 2025 trends like dynamic designs. For trailers, include simple auto-generated ones (e.g., short gameplay clips scripted via AI tools), but prioritize thumbnails at launch to minimize complexity, with trailers as a post-launch feature if community demand grows. Avoid over-reliance on AI art to prevent backlash, ensuring human oversight for quality.

Safety & Abuse Prevention

Rate limits per user/day?

Set a rate limit of 3 submissions per user per day to prevent abuse while encouraging participation in a teen-focused server, aligning with Discord bot best practices that emphasize custom throttling to avoid API rate limits (e.g., 50 requests/second globally) and reduce spam. This can be enforced via bots (e.g., tracking via database or cache), with notifications for exceeded limits and resets at midnight UTC; higher limits (e.g., 5-10) could be unlocked for verified/active users post-launch based on community feedback.

Anti-spam/raiders plan?

Employ a multi-layered strategy: Enable Discord's built-in AutoMod for automatic spam detection (e.g., blocking excessive mentions or links) and raid prevention (e.g., alerting on suspicious joins). Require member verification (e.g., CAPTCHA or reaction roles) for new joins, activate slow mode in submission channels, and use bots like Dyno or Carl-bot for anti-raid features such as auto-bans on mass joins or alt detection. Moderators will monitor via logs, with emergency lockdowns (e.g., pause submissions) for raids, ensuring a safe environment per 2025 safety updates.

Reporting and takedown workflow?

Users report issues via Discord's native tools (e.g., right-click message > Report) for platform-level abuse, or custom bot commands (e.g., /report [reason]) for server-specific concerns, routing to a mod channel for review. Workflow: Report received → Mod assesses (e.g., warn, mute, or ban offender; delete content) → Log action and notify reporter (anonymously if needed) → Escalate to Discord Trust & Safety for severe violations. For generated games, include in-game report buttons linking back to Discord for quick takedowns (e.g., unpublish if inappropriate), with clear server rules outlining the process to promote transparency.

Monetization & Costs

Is this free? If not, what model (Patreon, Discord roles, Robux passes, queue priority)?

Yes, the service will be primarily free to maximize accessibility and community growth in the Roblox ecosystem, but adopt a freemium model for sustainability, drawing from common 2025 Discord monetization strategies like premium roles and queue priority. Basic submissions and generations remain free with standard queue times, while paid tiers (e.g., via Discord roles unlocked through Patreon donations or one-time Robux passes) offer perks like faster queue priority (e.g., bump to the front), extra submissions per day, or custom features (e.g., advanced templates). This avoids full paywalls, aligns with Roblox community servers selling assets or commissions, and uses tools like Whop for seamless integration.

Monthly budget target for infra + AI usage?

Target a monthly budget of $100–$500 for infrastructure and AI usage, scaling with user volume, based on 2025 estimates for similar AI-driven bots and game generation pipelines. Infrastructure (e.g., Discord bot hosting on cloud services like AWS or Heroku) starts near-free for basic setups but realistically $10–$50/month for reliable performance and databases. AI usage (e.g., via OpenAI APIs for prompts or Roblox-integrated tools) adds $50–$450, depending on generation frequency—usage-based at $0.10–$10 per call for low-volume, or subscriptions like $15–$500 for no-code agents. Aim low initially by leveraging free Roblox AI features where possible, with buffers for spikes.

Tech & Ops

Preferred stack/language? (Node/TypeScript for Discord bot is common; Python also fine.)

Opt for Node.js with TypeScript as the primary stack for the Discord bot and backend pipeline, as it's a common, performant choice for real-time applications like this—leveraging the official discord.js library for seamless integration, TypeScript for type safety in handling AI prompts and moderation queues, and its ecosystem for easy scaling with tools like PM2 for process management. This aligns with 2025 trends where Node/TS dominates Discord bot development for its speed and community support, while Python (e.g., with discord.py) is a solid alternative if you prefer simpler syntax or heavier AI integrations (e.g., via Hugging Face), but Node/TS edges out for better async handling in high-concurrency scenarios like queue tracking.

Hosting preference (Railway/Render/Vercel/AWS/GCP)?

Prefer Vercel for hosting the bot and any web-adjacent components (e.g., a dashboard for metrics), as it's serverless, free for starters, auto-scales effortlessly, and integrates natively with Node/TS projects via Git deploys—ideal for a low-maintenance setup with built-in CI/CD. For more robust needs (e.g., databases or AI workloads), fallback to AWS (e.g., Lambda for functions, EC2 for persistent bots) due to its flexibility and cost-effectiveness at scale ($0.20/GB-month for storage), though it requires more setup. Avoid Railway/Render for core hosting unless budget is ultra-tight, as Vercel/AWS offer better uptime and integrations per 2025 benchmarks; GCP is overkill unless leveraging specific AI services like Vertex AI.

Logging/metrics/alerts requirements?

Require comprehensive logging (e.g., via Winston or console in Node, structured JSON outputs) for all events—submissions, moderations, generations, and errors—stored in a free-tier database like MongoDB Atlas for querying. Metrics should track key indicators like submission volume, queue times, failure rates, and user engagement using Prometheus/Grafana for visualization, with alerts set up via Slack/Discord webhooks or PagerDuty for critical issues (e.g., >5% failure rate or bot downtime >5 minutes). Aim for auto-alerts on anomalies (e.g., spam surges) to maintain safety, with daily summaries for mods—keeping it lightweight to fit the $100–$500 monthly budget while ensuring compliance and scalability.

Timeline & Success

MVP deadline?

Success metrics (e.g., #submissions/week, % published, avg session time, retention)?





Moderators & workflow

How many human mods do you expect at MVP? (e.g., 2–3 volunteers vs 10+)

Aim for 2–3 volunteer moderators at MVP launch, as this aligns with best practices for small, startup Discord communities where activity is low and overstaffing can dilute responsibilities, per Reddit discussions on member-to-mod ratios (e.g., 5-10 for 1000+ members, scaling down for starters). This volunteer-based approach fits the $100–$500 budget, focusing on passionate community members (e.g., active teens or Roblox enthusiasts) trained via simple guidelines, with potential to expand to 5+ as the server grows.

Do you want a SLA target for reviews (e.g., “under 12 hours”)? The queue logic can enforce this.

Yes, set an SLA target of under 24 hours for reviews to ensure timely feedback and maintain user engagement in a teen-oriented queue system, enforceable via bot logic (e.g., auto-alerts to mods if pending >12 hours, escalating at 24). This is achievable with 80% automation and volunteer mods, drawing from community standards where quick responses (e.g., 12-48 hours) prevent frustration in similar suggestion-based servers.

Branding & attribution

Final Roblox Group name?

Based on creative suggestions from Roblox group name generators and communities, and confirming availability through searches showing no existing matches, the final Roblox Group name will be "Prompted Playgrounds"—it's fun, thematic for AI-prompted game creation, and evokes a playful, community-driven space aligned with the server's kid-friendly focus.

Preferred attribution format in-game (e.g., “Idea by @User in #prompts”, splash screen, end credits)?

Use a splash screen (loading or intro GUI) with the format “Idea by @User from Discord” for clear, visible attribution, supplemented by end credits or game description mentions for redundancy. This keeps it simple, ties back to the Discord community, and avoids clutter while giving proper shoutouts.

Template library MVP

Do you want me to seed with 3 hand‑curated templates per genre (Obby/Tycoon/Simulator) or start with 1 each and grow?

Start with 1 hand-curated template per genre (Obby, Tycoon, Simulator) and grow iteratively, as this minimizes initial complexity for the MVP while allowing expansion based on community feedback and leveraging freely available resources like Buzzy.GG's templates or uncopylocked assets for quick curation. Hand-curate the single templates to ensure baseline playability, safety, and alignment with kid-friendly prompts before scaling to 3+ per genre.

Any must‑include mechanics for launch? (e.g., checkpoints in Obby, 2–3 tier upgrade loop in Simulator, income/upgrade cycle in Tycoon)

Yes, enforce must-include mechanics for each genre to guarantee fun and replayability: For Obby, checkpoints for progression and varied obstacles like disappearing parts or crushers to add challenge; for Tycoon, an income/upgrade cycle with at least 2–3 tiers, resource management, and basic customization options like buildings or cosmetics; for Simulator, a 2–3 tier upgrade loop focused on grinding, collection (e.g., pets or items), and leveling systems to create addictive progression without being overly mindless. These can be templated in Lua scripts for consistent AI generation.

Queue & freemium

Free tier: 3/day/user → OK.

The free tier with 3 submissions per user per day is confirmed as the baseline, providing accessible entry for all users while maintaining server sustainability through rate limiting, as previously discussed.

Premium: which perks at MVP? (Queue priority only, or also +2 submissions/day?)

At MVP, premium perks will include both queue priority (e.g., bumping to the front of the moderation/generation queue for faster turnaround) and +2 submissions per day (totaling 5), to offer meaningful value without overcomplicating the initial rollout. This dual perk system is easy to implement via Discord role assignments (e.g., linked to Patreon tiers starting at $5/month or Robux passes), encourages upgrades for active users, and fits within the $100–$500 monthly budget by leveraging existing bot features for enforcement.

Ops & alerts

Where should alerts go? (private #ops Discord channel ok?)

Yes, route alerts to a private #ops Discord channel, as this keeps them contained for moderators without cluttering main channels, aligns with standard Discord ops practices for bots (e.g., using webhooks for targeted notifications), and ensures quick response times in a secure, role-restricted space.

Daily digest time (your timezone is America/Chicago): morning or evening?

Schedule the daily digest for the morning (e.g., 8 AM America/Chicago), to provide a fresh start-of-day overview for moderators, allowing them to address insights proactively before peak user activity, while fitting within typical community management routines where mornings are for planning.

Timeline

Rough MVP target (e.g., 4–6 weeks)? I’ll shape milestones to fit.

As soon as possible.
